## Why you should stop installing development environments locally

This is a placeholder post for my talk about containers / Docker from [re:develop conference][1] 2015 conference in Bournemouth. I'll eventually write up the main points in a proper blog post form, but for now have a look at the embedded slides and video recording.

### Slides

<!-- This paragraphs is a workaround to make `gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe` keep the embed object the same as content width -->
<p>

<object data="/media/containerise_everything_talk.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="1920" height="1080">
    <embed src="/media/containerise_everything_talk.pdf">
        This browser does not support embedding PDFs. Please download to view it: <a href="/media/containerise_everything_talk.pdf">Download containerise_everything_talk.pdf</a>.
    </embed>
</object>

</p>

### Code

Make sure to also have a look at the [companion repository on Github][2], which shows how to set up a Node based development environment with Docker. Of course it would work with anything else which runs on Linux, but this simple working example should give you a good starting point.
